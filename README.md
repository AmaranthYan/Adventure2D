## Intro
Inspired and motivated by an idea that I had for a long time, I made this multi-role 2D platform game. The game tells an adventure story of two little animals (a puppy and a bunny), each has its own unique ability. The two little animals have to cooperate with each other in ordre to solve puzzles and reach the very end of their jounery.  
The game consists of 10 simple levels and the total length of gameplay is between 20-30 mins.  
I hereby thank **@Uaecrom**, my best friend and an amateur artist, who supported me and helped me with all the amazing background artworks in the game.
